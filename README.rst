AERMOD_ is a steady-state plume model that incorporates air dispersion based on planetary boundary layer turbulence structure and scaling concepts, including treatment of both surface and elevated sources, and both simple and complex terrain.  

This version of AERMOD_ is slightly tweaked to compile under linux with 
gfortran compiler.
